Work toward a CRF layer for Keras.

Run self-test with

    ./test.sh

Based on CRF implementation in Guillaume Lample's tagger
(https://github.com/glample/tagger), parts of which are included in
the lample-tagger/ directory (MIT license).

This is incomplete and not recommended for any serious use.

Developed and tested (only) on

- Keras 1.1.0
- Theano 0.8.2
- TensorFlow 0.11.0rc0
- CPU
